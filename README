Welcome to FluoroStronger.

This takes either Bruker fids and tries to process them using
nmrPipe, or takes text files of data from topspin/mestrec or
whereever.

A user then specifies a set of initial conditions, numbers
of singlets or quartets. They should simulate the spectrum,
make sure the initial conditions are okay, then run the fitting.

Results are dumped to a text file. If gnuplot is in the path,
the program will make a nice figure for you to play with.

The program is setup to run on a dataset. Use this to make
sure you can operate the program. Then edit the input
script for your problem.

############################################################
To execute, you need python3 installed and in the system path.

From this folder then type:

python RunMe.py

or

python3 RunMe.py

The code will do the rest. Edit RunMe.py to get to the settings.
#############################################################
FluoroStronger is in python3.

Dependencies: all python modules are standard.

For processing, the python module nmrGlue is required (which can be 
installed via pip) as well as nmrPipe. Make sure the nmrPipe tools
are in the system's path (such as pipe2txt.tcl), which will be the
case if you move into cshell as described for routine nmrPipe usage.

To fit data, you just need a text file of your data, which could
come from topsin, mestrec, or wherever. 

To get nice figures, gnuplot must be installed and in the
path. If gnuplot is not there, not a problem, just open the output
in your favourite spreadsheet and plot it.

Have fun!
