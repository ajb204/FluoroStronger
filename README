Welcome to FluoroStronger.

This takes either Bruker fids and tries to process them using
nmrPipe, or takes text files of data from topspin/mestrec or
whereever.

A user then specifies a set of initial conditions, numbers
of singlets or quartets. They should simulate the spectrum,
make sure the initial conditions are okay, then run the fitting.

Results are dumped to a text file. If gnuplot is in the path,
the program will make a nice figure for you to play with.

The program is setup to run on a dataset. Use this to make
sure you can operate the program. Then edit the input
script for your problem.

To execute:

from this folder type:

python RunMe.py

The code will do the rest. Edit RunMe.py to get to the settings.
#############################################################
FluoroStronger is in python2.7. I appreciate this is depreciated.

Dependencies: all python modules are standard.
It does require the excellent nmrglue (which can be installed via pip).

To get nice figures, gnuplot must be installed and in the
path. If gnuplot is not there, not a problem, just open the output
in your favourite spreadsheet and plot it.

Have fun!
